# EEC172_Labs
Embedded systems labs and lab reports. 

Lab 1:
  Learning how to use Code Composer, Uniflash, Pin Mux Config.
  
Lab 2:
  Interface with 128x128 OLED and run graphics on it.
  Program a ball game that interfaces with the on-board accelerometer.
  
Lab 3:
  Implement a multi-tap bidirectional text messaging program using IR for text transmission and UART for board-to-board communication.
  
Lab 4:
  Implement a multi-tap bidirectional text messaging program using Dual Tone Multi-Frequency (DTMF) for text transmission and UART for board-to-board communication.
  Adafruit microphone for analog input into the ADC for conversion into digital format for decoding on the MCU.
  
Lab 5:
  Have the MCU communicate and update an object on Amazon Web Services using RESTful POST/GET commmands
  
Lab 6:
  Combining all concepts that we learned:
    Multiplayer games - Connect 4, Tic-Tac-Toe, Rock, Paper, Scissors
    UART used for board-to-board communication
    SPI used with OLED 
    AWS updated with leaderboard after every game ends
